Astra is the analysis framework for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS V) Milky
Way Mapper. The purpose of Astra is to manage the analysis of reduced data
products from SDSS V and to streamline data releases.


Motivation
==========

Milky Way Mapper will acquire data products that differ from previous generations
of SDSS. High-resolution infrared spectra will continue to be acquired using the
APOGEE spectrographs, but this will be complemented with low-resolution BOSS-like
optical spectra. A wide range of scientific targets (e.g., red giants, main-sequence
exoplanet host stars, white dwarfs) are expected to be observed in both wavelengths.
This change in strategy requires an analysis framework to manage the analysis of
targets, to encourage improvements to existing analysis approaches, and to
streamline the data release process.
