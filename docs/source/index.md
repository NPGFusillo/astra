# Astra

## The analysis framework for the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper

Astra is the analysis framework for the [Milky Way Mapper](https://www.sdss5.org/mappers/milky-way-mapper/) (MWM), one of the three mapper programs in the [fifth generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03234) of the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss5.org/) (SDSS V). The purpose of Astra is to manage the analysis of reduced data products from SDSS V and to streamline data releases.


Milky Way Mapper will produce data products that differ from previous generations of SDSS. High-resolution infrared spectra will continue to be acquired using the APOGEE spectrographs, but this will be complemented with low-resolution optical spectra. A wide range of scientific targets (e.g., red giants, main-sequence exoplanet host stars, white dwarfs) will be observed by both instruments. This change in strategy requires a framework to manage the analysis of targets, to encourage improvements to existing analysis approaches, and to streamline the data release process.
