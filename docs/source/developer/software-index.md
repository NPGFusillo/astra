The [Astra code base](https://github.com/sdss/astra) is publicly hosted on GitHub. While any member of the SDSS team on GitHub should have write access to this repository, you are encouraged to fork the repository, create a new branch, commit your code changes, and create a pull request. This will allow the [testing suite](developer/tests) to run before the modified code is introduced to the main branch, and it allows for your code to be reviewed.
